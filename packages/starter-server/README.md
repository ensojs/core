# Enso starter (Server)

A barebones koa server demonstrating the following features :

* Loading `.env` secrets safely using `dotenv-safe`
* An `IoC` container provided by `inversify`
* `koa` decorators though `inversify-koa`
* A `TestHarness` for testing controllers
* `jest` as our primary test runner

## TODO

[ ] Move this to its own `starters` repo so its not conflated with the framework
