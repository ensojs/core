# Enso

Enso is framework built with typescript that provides developers a consistent framework for designing backend services.

Enso seeks to create a balanced community that is informed by both classical
and modern Software Architecture and programming principles.

## Release management and versioning

Enso employs the [GitHub Flow](https://gitversion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git-branching-strategies/githubflow/) branching strategy for its monorepo.

This means that all packages will move versions in lockstep.
