## Philosophy

Enso seeks to create a balanced respectful community informed by classical Software Architecture and Programming principles. eg. `Gang of Four` patterns such as Repositories, Factories and et. al in addition to modern `"enterprise"` approaches such as Domain Driven Design.

- We aim to create, develop technology that is well designed and thought through
- We also openly acknowledge and give credit to the developers work we leverage
