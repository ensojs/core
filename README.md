## Contributing

We use [changesets](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets) to coordinate releases.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch with the relevant converntional changelog prefix. eg `feat/your-branch`, `fix/your-branch` etc. Check which [prefixes are enabled](./package.json).

## Philosophy

Enso seeks to create a balanced respectful community informed by classical Software Architecture and Programming principles. eg. `Gang of Four` patterns such as Repositories, Factories and et. al in addition to modern `"enterprise"` approaches such as Domain Driven Design.
